**Champ Frequency** pie chart - how much you play each champ
- on mouseover, give a mouse-connected data box
**Champ winrate** pie chart - win percentage with each champ
 - weighted somehow to give more value to more games played to eliminate the problem of 1W/0L 100% WinRate
*Game Performance* streamograph of:
 - Amplitude => some indicator of how GOOD the game went, i.e. Win(1.0) or Lose(0.25) multiplied by some relevant factor

 - for Support, *Assists*
 - for Tank, *Damage Taken*
 - for all champs, *Gold Earned*
 - other selectable amplitude factors
*Stat by Game* bar graph - specific stats about each game
