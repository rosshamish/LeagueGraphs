####A free online statistics tracker for League of Legends
####Readme last updated Nov 02, 2012

**Here's how it works:**

- Statistics are accessible for any player's 10 most recent games.

- Once your name has been entered *once* on [LeagueGraphs](http://www.rosshamish.netau.net), it is added to the auto-update php machine.
- Each player is updated about once or twice a day.

- A manual update happens when you access your data on the site, so graphs/data are guaranteed up-to-date whilst also maintaining long-term consistency.

**The site is still heavily in beta.**

Please give it some slack while it is in development :) 

If you notice something wrong, some weird formatting or data or wrong values, seriously anything, please [email me!](mailto:ross.anderson87@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub] [LeagueGraphs] Bug Report)

**Implemented Features:**

- Database consistency and stability.
- Automatic database updates daily.
- Data availability in graph format (using [Dan Foreman-Mackey](http://dan.iel.fm/)'s very cool [xkcd.js](http://dan.iel.fm/xkcd/))

---

**Planned Features:**

- Data availability via tables and custom searching.
- A real domain and web host.
- Custom analysis
    - What is the relationship between my total gold earned and my time spent dead?
    - What is the relationship between the number of wards I buy and my winrate?
    - How often do I win with item A vs item B?

**Known deficiencies:** (besides it not actually being functional yet)

- Data currently only available for NA servers
    - This is easily fixable, but for now simplicity is king.
- I don't have money to pay for server space to handle lots of people.
    - This is easily fixable with [donations :)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=5AK9LPZFB54L8&lc=CA&item_name=RossHamish%20Lol%2dStats%20Server&currency_code=CAD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted)
