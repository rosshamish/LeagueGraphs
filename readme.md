#Lolstatter
(name still undecided, [suggest one!](mailto:ross.anderson87@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub] [Lol-Stats] Name Suggestion))

##A free online statistics tracker for League of Legends

Here's how it works: 
1. Statistics are available for your 10 most recently played games.
2. Each time you come to [lolstatter](http://www.rosshamish.netau.net/lol/) and enter your Summoner Name (e.g. mine is RossHamish
3. 

###Lolstatter (if that's what we're calling it for now) is still HEAVILY in beta, 

Please give it some slack while it is in development :) 

If you notice something wrong, some weird formatting or data or wrong values, seriously anything, please [email me!](mailto:ross.anderson87@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub] [Lol-Stats] Bug Report)

Planned Features:

- Data availability via tables and custom searching.
- Custom analysis
    - What is the relationship between my total gold earned and my time spent dead?
    - What is the relationship between the number of wards I buy and my winrate?
    - How often do I win with item A vs item B?
    - [Suggest a data point](mailto:ross.anderson87@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub] [Lol-Stats] Data Suggestion)
- Graph support (likely using the very cool [xkcd.js](http://dan.iel.fm/xkcd/))
- [Suggest a feature](mailto:ross.anderson87@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub] [Lol-Stats] Feature Request)

Known deficiencies: (besides it not actually being functional)
- Data currently only available for NA servers
    - This is easily fixable, but for now simplicity is king.
- I don't have money to pay for server space to handle lots of people.
    - This is easily fixable with [donations :)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=5AK9LPZFB54L8&lc=CA&item_name=RossHamish%20Lol%2dStats%20Server&currency_code=CAD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted)
